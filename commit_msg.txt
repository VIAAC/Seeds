10 February 2014: VIAAC Planning, Sources

Added a failure contingency section to the VIAAC planning document.  After considering corruption and how to deal with it, I decided to grab a number of different studies on the subject.  They are now in a folder marked "sources", and that will contain the scientific literature supporting any documents in the project.
